# Game Proposal

Umbrella simulator

Basic:
The user pilots an umbrella floating above a person
The user must keep their guy dry as they walk from the start to finish


Visuals:
Isomorphic view
The umbrella is kept near the center of the screen 
Real time bar showing the guy's wetness level
Animation to show rain intensity and direction
Animation to show wind intensity and direction
Animation for lightning strike and temporary tattered look after a direct strike


Difficulty:
Depends on the number of people in the crowd
Depends on how similar the people look
Depends on the number of buildings that the person walks under
Depends on how randomly the person walks to the destination
Depends on how wet the person is allowed to get
Strong rain events, the rain rate changes throughout the level and based on level difficulty
Wind can blow the umbrella around, forcing the user to correct
Wind can adjust the angle of the rain, requiring umbrella adjustment
The guy can panic based on environmental factors like a lightning strike
Strikes are more common the higher the difficulty
If lightning strikes the umbrella it is disabled for a few seconds

Movement:
Using W or S moves forward or backward and A and D are used to rotate left and right
OR WASD moves the umbrella around in each direction
Movement is based on momentum and acceleration -- the umbrella has "inertia"
Possibility of different controls for other platform integration

Progression:
The user can get different umbrellas
Some can be very large
Some can be transparent
Over time upgrade the water resistance of the guy
Buy skins for the guy that make him slightly more obvious, including ones that are extremely obvious but equally expensive
Upgrade lightning resistance of umbrella
Upgrade wind resistance of umbrella
Upgrade the speed of the umbrella
Heater upgrade that dries the guy faster
Umbrellas are purchasable and each one has a specialty -- all still upgradable but emphasis on specialty
Daily challenges & procedurally generated levels
Achievements: ex. Keep the guy dry for 5,10 consecutive minutes; Keep the guy dry for 5, 10 miles, ect.

Environment:
Levels have different themes like city, industrial, park, china, europe, etc.
Buildings provide shelter from the rain but also obscure the view of the guy until he emerges
Overall story line behind the guy's life that's reflected in his missions: ex. He takes medicine from the pharmacy to a sick friend, or brings a gift to work for his boss
Easter eggs that you can reach if you take the umbrella off the guy and move it to the correct spot before the game ends

Extra:
Survival modes -- survive for as long as possible in difficult conditions
Sandbox or creative mode -- level designer & modder
